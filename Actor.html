          <h1> Hello, I am the <br> Rock</h1>
          <p>I entered Hollywood and the film industry, becoming a star initially through my wrestling popularity and noted work ethic. 
Over my acting career, I became one of the highest paid and most successful actors in Hollywood.
I began his acting career on television while wrestling. 
In my first television acting job, in 1999, I played my own father in an episode of That '70s Show called "That Wrestling Show". 
Nearly a year later, I appeared in the Star Trek: Voyager episode "Tsunkatse" as an alien wrestler who fought popular character Seven of Nine. 
While I was away from WWE, the company continued to sell "The Rock" merchandise, and I continued to be featured prominently in the opening montages of their television shows.
After that I did many successful movies like the Fast & Furious series, Jumangi, Rampage etc.</p>
