          <h1> Hello, I am the <br> Rock</h1>
          <p>After my football career, I decided to pursue a career as a professional wrestler.
Veteran wrestler Pat Patterson got me several tryout matches with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996. 
Under my real name, I defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show on March 10 and lost matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart.
After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association as Flex Kavana and winning the USWA World Tag Team Championship twice with Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, I signed a WWF contract. 
I received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.
I have since been a successful WWE/WWF player.</p>
