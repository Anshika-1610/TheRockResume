          <h1> Hello, I am the <br> Rock</h1>
          <p>I was a promising football prospect and received offers from many Division I collegiate programs.
 I decided on a full scholarship from the University of Miami where I mostly played defensive tackle.
 In 1991, I was on the Miami Hurricanes' national championship team.
I would appear in a backup role, starting only one game in four years, playing behind players such as Pro Football Hall of Famer Warren Sapp.

After I graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of General Studies in criminology and physiology, I signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League as a linebacker. 
I was assigned to the practice roster but was cut two months into the season.</p>
